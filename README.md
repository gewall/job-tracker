# Job Tracker

## Description  
The Job Tracker web application was developed to address a common problem faced by job seekers. With so many job portals and direct applications available, job seekers often forget where they have applied. This issue highlights the need for a centralized system that can record and manage all job applications in one place.  

The main purpose of Job Tracker is to provide an efficient solution for organizing and monitoring job applications, helping users stay on top of their job search process in a structured way.
